    <h1>Structured TYPO3 practice, tailored to your syllabus.</h1>
    <p>
        The learning hub will orchestrate lessons, summaries, and flashcard-style quizzes built from TYPO3
        documentation chunks stored in the vector index. Local Ollama models will craft adaptive questions
        using the syllabus topic you pick.

        For now, treat this page as a design canvas. Sketch out the module selector, study streak tracker,
        and contextual hints panel that will appear alongside each exercise.
