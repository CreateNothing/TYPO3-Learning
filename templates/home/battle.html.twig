    <h1>Competitive TYPO3 duels are on the way.</h1>
    <p>
        Battle mode will let up to four learners join a five-minute sprint where everyone receives
        the same set of TYPO3 implementation questions. Scores remain hidden until the clock expires,
        then a live leaderboard crowns the champion.

        Placeholder content lives here while we connect the real-time question generator,
        scoring logic, and WebSocket transport. Use this space to plan UI components or wireframe
        the duel lobby, countdown timer, and results reveal sequence.
